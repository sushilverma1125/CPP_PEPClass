/*
Approach:

Divide into Sorted and Unsorted: The algorithm conceptually divides the input list into a sorted portion (initially empty) and an unsorted portion (the entire list).

Find the Minimum: In each iteration, it finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion.

Swap: It then swaps this smallest element with the first element of the unsorted portion, effectively extending the sorted portion by one element.

Repeat: This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. 

Selection sort has a time complexity of O(nÂ²) in all cases (best, average, and worst) and a space complexity of O(1) because it performs sorting in place.
